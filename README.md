WIP

The tagline for this whole GLP is "Dynamic Defense", meaning that we look to apply physical and cyber defense concepts in an environment, but that both environments affect the other in some way. This GLP would be primarily focused on base defense, but would include some side missions that pop up outside the base.
A lot of defense, as you know, isn't a matter of how fast you can counter-type against an attacker. Instead, it's how well you set up services or use tools to protect your infrastructure. So what I want to do is focus on a small handful of services and tools, no more than 3, for the cadets to either deploy or use in some fashion. A list of potential options include:

1. Firewall rules
2. Snort/Suricata
3. Policies (i.e. passwords, number of user accounts)
4. Anything from Sysinternals
5. Vulnerability scanner (i.e. Nessus)
6. Basic networking (i.e. PacketTracer)

As the GLP continues, there may be a list of cyber-related tasks that need doing. For example, getting the IP address of each cadet's phones and allowing traffic from them to the main computer via firewalls. Or, comms just went down, so cyber has to complete some short task (i.e. "find the malware with X tool") to get them back up, and until they do people on the ground are not allowed to communicate. They would be very simple tasks, but there would be enough of them that the cyber operator needs to prioritize what needs doing as the GLP goes along.
At the same time, the people guarding the cyber operator would need to conduct base defense procedures. There may be people moving in and out, or they may have to go question/detain someone sketchy-looking. Maybe during the GLP, the cyber operator loses the use of some tool or service, but intel has located the source of the disturbance (an enemy hacker nearby). It would be a matter of covering each other's backs, and having a direct, tangible impact on both of their tactical missions.
